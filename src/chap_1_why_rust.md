# Rust? ðŸ¦€

## History and Community

- 2010 - kicked off by Mozilla Research
- A running favourite in Stack Overflow's yearly [survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)

  - [r/rust on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/)
  - [Rust forums](https://users.rust-lang.org/)

## The Motivation

- Microsoft [reported](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/18/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/) that 70%~ of vulnerabilities assigned a CVE are memory safety issues
- Google Chromium [reports](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety) a similar figure

The goal of Rust is to prevent these issues as early as possible.
